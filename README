Assumptions:

	- No empty strings in the file
	- The specified tuple size is smaller than the length of each file


Command to compile:

	- make


Algorithm:

	- First, the program creates a hashtable using the file of synonyms. Each
	  line of the file represents a group of synonyms, and each synonym in the
	  file is hashed as a key-value pair of itself and the first synonym in the
	  group.
	- Then, the program creates another hash table using the first file
	  supplied (other than the synonym table). Using the specified 'n', every
	  n-tuple from the file is preprocessed such that each synonym from a group
	  is replaced with the first synonym from that group (using the hash table
	  created above), and then stored in the hash table.
	- The program then iterates through every n-tuple in the second file
	  (preprocessed as above) using a vector; if the n-tuple exists in the
	  hash table created using the first file, it is considered a hit.
	- The total percentage of hits is calculated using the number of hits and
	  the number of n-tuples in the second file and output to standard output.
